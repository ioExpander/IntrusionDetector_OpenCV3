IntrusionDetector_OpenCV3

2 scripts I used to monitor my home and garden during holidays.
Both work on raspberry pi and using RSTP video streams. I used Xiafang Camera hacked with xiaofang-hacks
Both programs also upload healthchecks every couple of hours to dropbox in a specific folder.

- IntrusionDetector will monitor your house and detects movements and upload video files to Dropbox if an intrusion is detected.
- GardenMonitor will simply do a timelapse and upload it to dropbox.

Use example configuration files if you want to use this.
